1.Class :-
-> Defination: class is collection of data member or member function.
					OR
		 : Class is blueprint of the object.

Data member- variable which was define inside the class 
Member function- function which was define inside the class

Class never occupie the memory 
Class get the memory via object (but the actually it's object's memory)

Class can have multiple objects
Class was defined by 'class' keyword.

you can define the data member but can't initialize the data member out the function.

syntax:
class class_name
{
    //body of class
};		 
		 
Example of class is, 
->It is a blue print such as if we bought a land / space & would like to build a beautiful house on that land then we first draw a sketch.

		 
2.Object :-
-> Defination: Object is a insstance of the class.

Object is a instence of the class.

Object is ocuppie the memory 

syntax:
class class_name 
{
    //code;
}object_name;
int main()
{
    class_name object_name;
}

Example of object is,
-> Acording to blue print we create a  bulding or house.



	For example Car: A car can be represented as a class in OOP. The class can have attributes such as make, model, year, and color, and methods such as start(), accelerate(), and stop(). Each individual car is an object of the Car class, with its own unique values for the attributes.
